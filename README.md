<h2>About TradeUP</h2>

<h2>“One man's trash is another man's treasure”</h2>

As individuals we end up with items that hold some kind of meaning to us. Whether the items significance is from nostalgia or utility, we collect them and they become part of our identity. 
There comes a time however when we no longer find those items valuable. And the results are always the same: selling it, giving it away, or (the worst option) throwing it away

But what if there was a platform where trading things for other items was easily accessible...

<h2>What is TradeUP</h2>

* TradeUP is an app that allows Users to trade items of all categories and calibers, with a twist: Its bartering only

* Our application will offer Users the ability to peruse inventory posted by others, actively persue trades with other "Seekers", and upon finding something they like, the ability to acquire each one anothers contact info for logistics purposes.

<h2>User Story</h2>

- AS A USER, I have items that I no longer have use for (ex. stroller, tools)

- AS A USER, I have items that I no longer need (ex. Previous game system, couch)

- But most importantly, AS A USER, I have items that I would rather trade for other items without the need for money

- I WANT to have a fun, easy-to-use platform in which I can trade/barter my items for others that I have interest in.

- SO THAT I can come away from the trade better than I started
